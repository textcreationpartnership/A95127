         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

privy Councell, The humble Petition of many Noblemen, Gentlemen, Burgeſſes and Miniſters occaſionally meeting at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh.
Humbly ſheweth.</hi> Wheras they upon the report &amp; fight of great Convocations ſuddenly endeavoured &amp; unexepctedly brought
into this great Counſell day, for the moſt part by theſe who have beene eſteemed by the Country and challenged by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as Incendiares, plotters, and enemies to the peace of this Kingdome, have occaſionally conveened at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> And having heard of Letters from
His Majeſty, and Declaration from the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> anent the preſent diſtractions of that Kingdome: They have reaſon from bygan expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and preſent preſumptions to feare the intentions and endeavours of theſe evill affected perſons and their adherents, leſt by their convocations
and ſollicitations they take occaſion of theſe differences to raiſe jealouſies and diviſions betwixt thir Kingdomes. And conſidering the common intereſt
of all the Subjects of the Kingdome to preſerve the late peace, ſo happily concluded betwixt theſe Nations, by the providence of God, his Majeſties
goodneſſe and wiſedome, and the mediation of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſolemnly eſtabliſhed by the late treaty, oath of Parliament, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
faith, and the great Seales of theſe Kingdomes. As in all other points, ſo eſpecially in theſe Articles (whereunto the reſt are called but prefaces)
for ſetling and entertaining a ſolid peace betwixt thir Nations in time coming; leſt upon any pretence they ſhould be daſht one againſt another.
Wherein it is declared the duty of the Eſtates yea of every ſubject for to conveene and ſuppreſſe any evill affected perſons who would raiſe Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Subjects of the ather Kingdome without conſent of Parliament as traytors to the Eſtate, much more to Petition againſt it, and wherein there
is appointed a Committee of the Eſtates for the conſervation of the peace in the interim betwixt Parliaments. All which the Petitioners amongſt the
reſt of the good Subjects of this Kingdome, did hazzard their lives and Eſtates, to obtaine: And did demand in the Treaty upon their dangerous experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Councel of <hi>England</hi> there medling in the affaires betwixt His Majeſty and this Kingdom; to the ingaging of the Nations in War, which is ſo
often condemned by the Eſtates of this Kingdome in their Remonſtrances, preſſing that common rule of Equity, <hi>To doe as you would be done unto:</hi> which
now is and may be retorted on this Kingdome. Like as deſiring earneſtly, that your Lordſhips in theſe publique reſolutions of ſo great conſequence
to thir Dominions may carry along with you the hearts and conſciences of the body of this Kingdome, and prevent that the breache grow not
wider by falſe confidences grounded upon ſuddaine undertakings of any perſons, as alſo their naturall affection and duty to their gracious Soveraign
according to their manifold obligations, and brotherly affection to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> forcing them to pray to God, and to deſire all men
according to their ſtations, to uſe all lawfull means, to breed and intertaine a good underſtanding betwixt His Majeſty and His Parliament, the ſureſt
foundation of greatneſſe to His Majeſty, and happineſſe to thir Kingdomes. Likewiſe taking to heart the dangerous conſequences to His Majeſty, and
to his Dominions if your Lordſhips anſwer by tendering the offer of your ſervice to His Majeſty againſt the demands, or upon the differences betwixt
His Majeſty and His Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> or any other manner of way import (which God forbid) any ingadging of your ſelves or their Nations in
warre, or any thing that may tend thereunto.</p>
            <p>Therefore in their owne names, and in the name of the reſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Burgeſſes, and Miniſters whoſe hearts doe, and hands would goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with this petition for preſervation of peace betwixt thir Kingdomes, they doe in all humility and earneſtneſſe, petition your Lordſhips in the
depth of your wiſedomes, ſeriouſly to ponder the conſequences of your anſwer to his Majeſty and the Parliament of England at this time, ſo as thereby
neither the confidence betwixt his Majeſty and his good Subjects here, nor amongſt themſelves, nor betwixt the Kingdomes (theſe unious tending e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to his Majeſties greatneſſe, and theſe diviſions to his prejudice) may be any wayes weakned, or their peace indangered. And to that end, that as your
Lordſhips would leave no lawfull meanes, according to your vocation and intereſt, unaſſayed for begetting a good underſtanding betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and his Parliament, being his greateſt and moſt unpartiall Councell, repreſenting the Body, whereof his Majeſty is the Head, and for removing
theſe diſtractions, (the continuance whereof will ever trouble the peace of this Kingdome) according to your Lordſhips laſt anſwer, ſo alſo ſeeing his
Majeſty requires not that your Lordſhips ſhould, neither can your Lordſhips judge of the Lawes and proceedings of another independent Kingdome;
and the Parliament of England offers to give all ſatisfaction concerning any meſſages or papers ſent to your Lordſhips anent their proceedings, that
your Lordſhips would be pleaſed carefully, to ſhun all offers of verball or reall ingadgements, either directly or by way of inference, without conſent of the
Parliament conforme to the treaty, which either may give any juſt occaſion of offence to their gracious Soveraigne, or of jealouſly to their brethren in
<hi>England,</hi> or of diſcourſe unto any, as if your Lordſhips did not obſerve that former rule of equity preſſed by themſelves during the time of your troubles,
<hi>To do to others as they will be done to themſelves.</hi> But did fall in the ſame fault, which your Lordſhips, and the reſt of the Eſtates of this Kingdome, had
condemned in the Councell of <hi>England;</hi> And for this effect they cannot but remember your Lordſhips that according to an Article of the Treatie,
there was appointed a Commiſſion <hi>als</hi> independent as any other, of ſo many of every Eſtate repreſenting the whole Kingdome, to prevent all occaſion
of diviſion betwixt thir Kingdomes, in the interim betwixt Parliaments. All which they humbly repreſent to your Lordſhips wiſe conſiderations,
and expect from your Lordſhips, ſo gracious an anſwer, as may ſatisfy their preſent fears, and ſecure them from theſe dangers in this interim betwixt
Parliaments, and thereby prevent all neceſſity of petitions of this kinde.</p>
            <p>Whilke ſupplication being read, heard and conſiderd by the ſaid Lords, and they finding the ſame to containe matters of publicke concernment, and
of that importance that requires mature deliberation: Therefore they continue the anſwer of this Petition till the morne, and ordains the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers

Gentry, Miniſters and Commons of the Kingdome of Scotland, wherewith the Lords of his Majeſties privy Councell were ſo highly offended, that they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuffer it to be regeſtred in their books (according to the cuſtome) nor would they returne any anſwer thereunto, but ordered the ſame to be altogether ſuppreſſed;
